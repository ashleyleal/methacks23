# symptoDoc
Inspiration

Symptodoc is driven by the recognition of two common challenges faced by individuals in Toronto: the confusion surrounding which doctor to visit and the lengthy wait times associated with appointments. To tackle these issues, we have developed an innovative solution. Our user-friendly platform allows individuals to input their symptoms, enabling us to provide personalized recommendations for suitable doctors. By leveraging advanced algorithms and a comprehensive database of medical specialists, we streamline the process of doctor selection, eliminating guesswork and confusion. Our goal is to empower Torontonians, simplifying their healthcare journey and contributing to a more efficient and satisfying healthcare system in the city.

What it does

SympyoDoc, equipped with a user-friendly chatbot named Jack, revolutionizes the way individuals address their healthcare needs. By interacting with Jack, users can effortlessly input their symptoms, initiating a personalized journey towards finding the most suitable doctor. Jack's intelligent algorithms analyze the symptoms and match them with a comprehensive database of medical specialists in Toronto. Through this seamless process, we empower users to make informed decisions about their healthcare, eliminating the uncertainty and frustration of finding the right doctor. With our project, we aim to enhance accessibility, efficiency, and patient satisfaction in the Toronto healthcare landscape.

How we built it

SymptoDoc was meticulously built using a combination of powerful tools and technologies. To collect and analyze symptoms, we utilized Cohere, an advanced language model that enabled us to understand and categorize healthcare-related inputs accurately. By leveraging its capabilities, we efficiently identified the most appropriate categories of healthcare based on the symptoms provided. To find the most suitable doctors within these categories, we integrated Google API, which allowed us to access and filter through a vast database of medical professionals in Toronto. The project's core functionality was developed using Visual Studio Code, where we seamlessly combined all the necessary functions and logic. For the web interface, we employed Flask, a Python web framework, to create a dynamic and user-friendly website. In terms of design, we utilized HTML and JavaScript to craft an intuitive and visually appealing interface, ensuring a smooth user experience. Through the synergy of these technologies, we have built a robust and comprehensive platform that simplifies the process of finding the right doctor for individuals in Toronto.

Challenges we ran into

Throughout the development process, we encountered various challenges that tested our problem-solving abilities and adaptability. One significant hurdle was the physical distance between team members, requiring us to find a way to collaborate effectively online. We overcame this obstacle by leveraging remote communication tools, enabling us to code together despite the geographical constraints. Another challenge arose when configuring the virtual environment for Flask, as we encountered compatibility issues that impeded our progress. We dedicated time and effort to research and troubleshoot, eventually finding a solution that allowed us to successfully set up the necessary environment. Furthermore, connecting Flask to Visual Studio Code proved to be a daunting task, requiring extensive debugging and exploration. Through perseverance and collaboration, we were able to establish the desired integration. Lastly, we faced difficulties in obtaining accurate and up-to-date doctor information. However, after careful consideration, we found a viable solution by leveraging Google API, which provided us with a reliable and comprehensive database of doctors. Despite the challenges, our team remained resilient, finding innovative solutions to each obstacle encountered, and ensuring the successful development of our healthcare recommendation platform.

Firstly, we successfully implemented an intuitive and user-friendly chatbot named Jack, which effectively collects symptoms from users, enabling a seamless and personalized experience. We are proud of integrating Cohere, which allowed us to accurately categorize and analyze symptoms, leading to more precise doctor recommendations. Overcoming the challenges of configuring the virtual environment for Flask was a significant accomplishment, as it enabled us to leverage this powerful framework to build a dynamic website. Additionally, we successfully connected Flask to Visual Studio Code, streamlining our development workflow and enhancing collaboration. Moreover, we managed to overcome the hurdle of obtaining accurate doctor information by leveraging Google API, ensuring reliable and up-to-date recommendations. These achievements showcase our team's dedication, problem-solving skills, and ability to deliver a functional and efficient solution that simplifies the process of finding the right doctor for users in Toronto.

What we learned

Throughout the development process, our team gained valuable insights and learned important lessons that have enriched our skills and understanding. We learned the importance of effective collaboration and communication, especially when working remotely and facing logistical challenges. Overcoming the hurdles of configuring virtual environments and connecting different technologies taught us the value of persistence, problem-solving, and the ability to adapt to unforeseen obstacles. We also deepened our understanding of utilizing external APIs, such as Google API, to enhance our platform's functionality and access reliable data sources. The experience of developing a healthcare recommendation system allowed us to appreciate the complexities of healthcare decision-making and the importance of user-centric design. Overall, this journey has provided us with a wealth of knowledge, practical experience, and a deeper appreciation for the intricacies of building innovative solutions that positively impact users' lives.

What's next for SymptoDoc

As we look to the future, our vision for SymptoDoc is to continue expanding and enhancing the platform to better serve the healthcare needs of individuals in Toronto. We plan to incorporate additional features that will further streamline the user experience, such as allowing Jack, our chatbot, to engage in interactive conversations with users, providing them with more personalized recommendations and guidance. Additionally, we aim to consider the distance between users and doctors when making recommendations, ensuring that geographical proximity is factored into the equation. This will enable users to find suitable healthcare providers who are conveniently located near them. We also intend to explore opportunities for integrating telehealth services, enabling users to consult with doctors remotely, thereby increasing accessibility and convenience. Through continuous improvement and innovation, we strive to make MediTrans a comprehensive and indispensable tool for navigating the healthcare landscape, empowering individuals to make informed decisions about their well-being with ease and confidence.
